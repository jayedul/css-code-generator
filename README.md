This application reduce css coding time. 

No need to write property name as they are created dynamically. Just create selector and choose them from dropdown list that will be visible when at least one selector exists. Press 'delete' to delete and 'modify' to customize declarations for the selected 'selector'. 

When you delete a selector, edit a declaration or make a field blank then css code will be automatically updated. Besides this the active selector name will be shown after the new selector creator text field. Every time you customize a declaration that goes to active selector. So checkout which selector is active below new selector creator text field. 

Finally you just copy and paste codes in code editor. Thats it.
