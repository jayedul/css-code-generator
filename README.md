This application reduce css coding time. 

No need to write property name as they are created dynamically. Just create selector and choose them from dropdown list that will be visible when at least one selector exists. Press 'delete' to delete and 'modify' to customize declarations for the selected 'selector'. 

When you delete a selector, edit a declaration or make a field blank then css code will be automatically updated. Besides this the active selector name will be shown after the new selector creator text field. Every time you customize a declaration that goes to active selector. So checkout which selector is active below new selector creator text field. 

It is very difficult to find out a property name by scrolling. Don't worry. Just write first one or two letter of the property in the text field that is located at the top-middle of the page. Then the property will be highlighted and come to your visible area.

To make a selector cross browser supported you have to select or write value where -webkit-, -moz- etc. prefix located. Generally they are in collapsible area where they are necessary.

Finally you just copy and paste codes in code editor. Thats it.
